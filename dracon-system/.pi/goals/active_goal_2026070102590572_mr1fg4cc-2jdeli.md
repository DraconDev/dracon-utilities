## Tasks

<!-- blockCompletion: false -->
- [x] diagnose: Diagnose the actual cause of the ENOSPC error — evidence: ENOSPC window 01:13:32–01:13:41 from dracon-sync trying to write loose git object in polis (dracon-platform/web/games/wip/polis). Preceded by 40+ retries on browser-extensions-shared symlink-pathspec 
- [x] verify-state: Verify current disk state and the recovery path — evidence: `df -h /` shows 222 GiB free on 906 GiB total (75% used) — well above the 8 KiB slack that caused the original ENOSPC. Top reclaimable: Downloads/.../dracon-platform/target=89 GiB, Dev/dracon-platform
- [ ] cleanup-reclaim: Reclaim the reclaimable disk space (one-shot, operator-approved) — contract: Run dracon-system storage --cleanup --apply (or equivalent) to remove the stale target dirs / caches identified; capture before/after df.
- [ ] enable-guard: Enable dracon-system-guard so future pressure auto-handles space — contract: systemctl --user enable --now dracon-system-guard.service; confirm 'active (running)'; confirm policy thresholds loaded (warn/action/critical) from ~/.dracon/utilities/system/dracon-system.toml.
- [ ] resync-failed: Recover the daemon-stuck pushes from the ENOSPC window — contract: Check /home/dracon/.local/state/dracon/dracon-sync-stuck-push-repos.json; resolve any remaining symlink-pathspec failures in browser-extensions-shared (separate issue blocking 40+ retries); verify a normal sync cycle completes without ENOSPC after the cleanup.
- [ ] report: Report findings to operator and complete — contract: Concise post-mortem: cause, action taken, why auto-handling didn't fire, what was changed to make it fire next time.
