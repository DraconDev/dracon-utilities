# Dracon System Source of Truth

`dracon-system` is a standalone repository and the canonical source for its
implementation, tests, configuration examples, and release metadata.

The parent `dracon-utilities` repository is a meta workspace. When this repo
is checked out at `dracon-utilities/dracon-system/`, the parent Cargo
workspace includes it by path; the parent does not mirror or overwrite its
files.

The daemon watches this repository directly and pushes its configured remotes.
Releases are cut from `scripts/release.sh` in this repository. The system
helper dependency is the published `dracon-system-lib` crate from crates.io;
no sibling `dracon-libs` checkout is required.

## Invariants

1. `main` is the active development branch.
2. The working tree remains buildable with `cargo test --workspace --locked`
   when used from the parent workspace or with `cargo test --locked` here.
3. The daemon's history rules in the parent `AGENTS.md` apply to this repo:
   agent loops do not rewrite published history.
